### About Thallium

**Thallium** is an independent programming studio founded in April 2025.  
It began as a collaboration between three tech enthusiasts — but quickly evolved.

Today, we're a team of **six people** driven by a shared vision:  
to create elegant, reliable, and meaningful software for real-world use.

We work on **three major projects** and a growing number of smaller tools and apps.  
Our strength lies in diversity — of thought, skills, and creativity.
