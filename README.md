### About Thallium

Thallium Studio is an independent software development studio founded in April 2025. What began as a collaboration between three tech enthusiasts has since evolved into a team of six, united by a shared vision: to create elegant, reliable, and meaningful software for real-world use. We specialize in crafting innovative projects from concept to launch, meticulously managing every stage to ensure precision and dedication.

Our strength lies in diversity—of thought, skills, and creativity. We work on three major projects and a growing number of smaller tools and apps, utilizing technologies such as Python, JavaScript, Lua, Java, React, and Vite. Beyond development, we focus on building strong, active communities around our creations, turning followers into dedicated brand ambassadors.

At Thallium Studio, we are committed to delivering digital experiences that captivate audiences and drive real growth.
